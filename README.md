# 👋 Hey there, I'm **Kshitiz Srivastava**

### Full Stack Developer | DevOps Enthusiast | Builder at Heart  

I’m that developer who doesn’t just write code — I **build things that actually work**.  
From full-stack web apps to AI-driven systems, I love bringing wild ideas to life.  

Deadlines? Nah. If I say *“I’ll finish it tomorrow,”* there’s a good chance you’ll get it *today.*  
I just love **building things, brohhhhhh** 

---

### What I Do Best
-  Build **scalable full-stack apps** with **MERN / Next.js / TypeScript**  
-  Architect **cloud-ready systems** using **Docker, Redis, AWS & microservices**  
-  Develop **AI-powered tools** that make tech *feel like magic*  
-  Automate repetitive stuff (because life’s too short for manual work)  

---

### Current Focus
Right now, I’m crafting **[AEON](#)** — a full-stack & mobile app builder that uses **AI** to generate code, deploy apps, and run projects *right in your browser.*  
It’s as insane as it sounds. ⚡

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
`JavaScript` · `TypeScript` · `React` · `Next.js` · `Node.js` · `Express` · `MongoDB` · `PostgreSQL`  
`Docker` · `Kubernetes` · `Redis` · `AWS` · `Prisma` · `Tailwind CSS`  

---

### Let’s Collaborate
I’m always down to talk tech, brainstorm product ideas, or debug something over caffeine.  
If you’ve got a project that needs passion, speed, and clean code — **I’m in**. 

---

### ⚡ Fun Fact
I code like I game — **focused, fast**, and with music that could power a rocket launch
